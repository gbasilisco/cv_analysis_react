 CV Analysis Tool - React Front-end

React Front-End for CV Analysis Tool with @mui/material UI Toolkit and Google Authentication

The React-based front-end for the CV Analysis Tool enhances user interaction with the existing Python utility. Leveraging the @mui/material UI toolkit, the front-end provides an intuitive and visually appealing interface that seamlessly integrates with the tool's powerful features. Google Authentication through Firebase ensures secure access, allowing users to efficiently analyze, manage, and compare CVs while maintaining data protection.

Key Features:

 1. User Authentication with Google: Integrate Google Authentication via Firebase, enabling users to log in securely using their Google credentials and access the CV Analysis Tool seamlessly.

 2. Keyword Search Interface: Implement an intuitive keyword search interface using @mui/material components. Users can input search terms to trigger CV analysis, enabling efficient extraction of relevant information from various CVs.

 3. CV Similarity Visualization: Create an interactive visualization component that displays CV similarities. This visual representation aids users in identifying overlaps and patterns in skills, work history, and other attributes across CVs.

By combining the capabilities of React, @mui/material, and Google Authentication, the CV Analysis Tool's front-end enhances user engagement and accessibility. Users involved in talent acquisition, recruitment, or HR management can efficiently manage and assess CVs, leveraging the power of Python-driven analysis with the added benefits of a user-centric and secure interface.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
